//The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into 
//the array indices; each array index represents a node; 
//For a zero-based array, the root node is stored at index 0; 
//if i is the index of the current node, then
//iParent     = floor((i-1) / 2)
//iLeftChild  = 2*i + 1
//iRightChild = 2*i + 2
